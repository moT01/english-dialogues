  "text": "Good morning, Sarah. Wow, it seems like you have a ton of energy this morning. What do you do to start the day off right? Hey James, thanks. Look, I don't do anything out of the ordinary, I think. I usually wake up around seven. The first thing I do is stretch a bit to wake up. Then I go straight to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. It's my morning fuel. Coffee is always a good start. What do you do after that? After coffee, I like to take a quick shower to freshen up. It helps me feel more alert and ready for the day. Then I get dressed. Jeans and a t-shirt, you know. Our company has a relaxed dress code and I like to keep it casual. Yeah, me too. What's next in your routine? Well, after that, I have a balanced breakfast. I often have cereal with some fruit and a glass of orange juice. Breakfast is important to keep my energy up during the morning. An early coffee and then breakfast. I had never thought of that. It helps me stay awake early in the morning. Anyway, before leaving for work, I like to check my emails and messages to see if there are any urgent updates from the team. I like to stay informed about any important tasks for the day. I can't imagine being so productive even before coming to work. Thanks for sharing, Sarah. I'll try some of these tips. Maybe I can get more productive in the morning as well. It's my pleasure. It's the consistency that helps me start the day off on the right foot.",
