  "text": "Hey, Sarah. How's work as a QA tester? Is it really challenging? Sometimes let me tell you how my week usually goes. Go on please. What's your weekly routine like? Well, on weekdays, I usually wake up at around six and get ready for work. That's early. What's your morning routine? In the morning, I have breakfast at home and then head to the office at eight. What's the first thing you do when you arrive? After I arrive, I check my emails and messages from the team. It helps me plan my day. Great. What's next? After that, during the morning, I start testing the software. I have a different task to do each day. For example, on Mondays, I test the login process. So you test different parts of the software each day? Exactly. At noon, I take a break and have lunch at the cafe down the street. Then in the afternoon, I test other features like the payment system. I see. What else do you do during the week? On Wednesdays, we have a team meeting at three. Next, I write test reports and document any bugs I found during the day. Sounds like a very productive week. Yes, there are a lot of things, but I like collaborating to improve the quality of our software. Thanks for sharing, Sarah. It's interesting to know what you do. You're welcome, Brian. When we have some time, I want to ask you about your week as a dev, okay? Sure thing.",
