  "text": "Hi Maria. I'm still getting to know the area. Is there an ATM nearby? Yes, there's a bank just a few blocks away. That's good to know. Are there any parks around here? Yes, there are a couple of parks near here. They're great for a break. How about restaurants? Are there any good restaurants in this neighborhood? Yes, there are many restaurants within walking distance. Fantastic. Is there anything else interesting to check out? Absolutely. There's a gym. There are also great coffee shops not too far away. How about bookstores or theaters? There isn't any theater around here that I know of. The bookstores I remember are all downtown, but there's a bus that stops two blocks away. Oh, how about a shopping mall? Malls are everywhere. I'm sure you can find them just by walking around a bit. Thanks for your help, Maria. You're welcome, Tom.",
