  "text": "Hi Tom, let me tell you what a regular day at our company normally looks like. We start at 9. The first thing to do is log into your computer and check your emails. Sounds good. What do I do after checking emails? After that, you'll probably attend the daily team meeting at 9.30. During the meeting, the team discusses project updates. I see. What about the rest of the day? During the rest of the day, you usually work on your design projects, collaborate with attend meetings with clients when there are those meetings. What time do we have our lunch break? You have a one hour lunch break around noon every day. Bring your lunch or go to one of the cafes nearby. The people from the team often do this. How long are our work days? We typically finish at about 5, but that depends on project deadlines. Thanks for explaining, Anna. It helps me to understand what to expect. You're welcome, Tom.",
