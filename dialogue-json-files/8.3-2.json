  "text": "Hey, Sarah, we need to prioritize the new features for the next release. I think we should focus on the mobile app version. I'm not sure I agree with that, Brian. The web app needs attention. It has more users. Prioritizing the web app makes more sense given its larger user base. Well, here's what I think we could do. Why don't we allocate resources to both platforms equally? We could give equal priority to both the web app and the mobile app. I still think we should dedicate more time to the web app, but I see where you're coming from, Brian. I think we can try giving equal priority for a while. Good. Thanks for your support.",
