It's the standard format, and it will make the information more accessible. True, but I was thinking we could try something different. Let's use an interactive demo instead of slides. It will engage the audience more effectively. Oh, I see what you mean. That's a great idea. It will certainly grab the audience's attention better. Awesome. We'll work on the interactive demo and make sure it's ready in time.",
