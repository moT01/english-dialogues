  "text": "Ugh, this class I'm working with is really complex. The documentation looks confusing. What should I do? When you're dealing with classes, begin by checking the class's name and properties. This will give you an idea of its purpose and its structure. Okay, what else? After that, you should read the methods and functions associated with the class. These can explain how to interact with the class and what you can achieve using it. I'll try to calm down and read the documentation more carefully. Thanks for the tips.",
