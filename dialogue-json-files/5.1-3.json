  "text": "Hey, Sarah, I was reading about object-oriented programming on the internet. It's a new concept for me. Object-oriented programming is used in many modern languages. How much do you know about it so far? Not much, really. I understand that there are classes and methods, but I've never used them in my code. No worries. Object-oriented programming is a fundamental concept in many languages. It involves classes, which are like blueprints for objects, and inside the classes, you find the class's methods, which are actions those objects can perform. That helps a lot. Can you recommend a good book for me to learn more about it? Of course. I have a book on OOP's principles. I'll send you the title. It has helped many people I know.",
