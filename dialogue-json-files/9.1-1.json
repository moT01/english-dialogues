  "text": "Hi, Tom. Thanks for submitting your code for review. Let's take a look together. Sure. I'm still trying to understand the code structure here. No worries. That's what code reviews are for. First, I'd suggest that you format the code consistently. It'll be easier for everyone to read. Got it. So if I indent the blocks consistently, it improves code readability? Exactly. Consistent indentation makes the code visually organized. It's a good practice. It also helps maintain ability. Now, let's talk about error handling. If you encounter potential issues, it's a good idea to use conditional statements to handle them gracefully. So I should include conditional statements to manage them? Absolutely. It prevents unexpected crashes and provides a better user experience. To finish, let's consider the comments. If you include comments when they're necessary, it helps future developers understand the logic. I see. So by explaining the complex parts with comments, I'll help other people understand the code better. Is that right? Precisely. It's a form of documentation within the code. Great job grasping these concepts. Thanks. And great tips, by the way. I'll make those suggested changes and submit the code again.",
