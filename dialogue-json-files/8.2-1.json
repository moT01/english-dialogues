  "text": "Brian, it's time to discuss our plans for the upcoming project. What do you think we should do? Well, we're going to use a framework for the frontend, probably React. It's the technology we're most comfortable with and it will make development faster. Good point. I agree. I also think we are going to need a dedicated UX designer. It's a complex project and a professional designer will help us create a great user interface. Absolutely. And as for the backend, I think we'll use Node.js. It's a solid choice and it will allow us to scale the application effectively. Sure thing. I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's finalize these plans and start assigning tasks.",
