  "text": "Sarah, have you heard about quantum computing? I just heard about it for the first time. Are you familiar with it? I know a little quantum computing uses special computers to perform calculations extremely quickly. That's cool. But what can it do besides calculating things? Well, it's not just for one thing. Quantum computers can also help scientists with research. They're useful for studying things like molecules and drugs. They can help people invent new medicines. Some people also use quantum computing for protecting information with encryption. Wow, that's amazing. Is it hard to understand how quantum computers work? They may seem complicated, but there are lots of simple videos that can help you understand the basic ideas.",
