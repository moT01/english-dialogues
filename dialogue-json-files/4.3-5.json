  "text": "Hey Maria, I wanted to check with you about the food we're going to get for the team meeting. I think there was a mix-up. Oh really? I thought it was all okay. What happened? Well, you mentioned we need 10 pounds of chicken wings, but I thought we agreed on 20 pounds. That's strange. I'm sure we decided on 10 pounds because it's a small gathering. Are you sure it's 20 pounds? You know, now that I think about it, I think I confused it with another event. Sorry. That's okay. And for the vegetarian options, you mentioned 5 large trays of salad, but I think 3 large trays is enough. There aren't many vegetarians on the team. That's my mistake too. It's definitely 3 trays of salad. I just wanted to make sure everyone has enough choices. And you're totally right to think this way. Thanks for double checking anyway. We want the team party to be a success.",
