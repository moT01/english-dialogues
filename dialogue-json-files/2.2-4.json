  "text": "Hey, Maria, is it true that you're never home in the evenings? How do you do that? Hi, Brian. Well, yeah, I like doing fun things in the evening. So I go out a lot. On Mondays, I have dance classes from six to 730. I love dancing. Oh, great. What about Tuesdays? On Tuesdays, I learn Japanese. I take online lessons at seven. I think it's the only day I'm home so early. Then on Wednesdays, I go to a local theater group. Practice goes until nine. We perform small plays. It's really fun. That's exciting. How about Thursdays? Thursdays are for watching shows. I look for live concerts or theater plays. It's my favorite time to relax. Wow. Do you rest at home on Fridays at least? Not at all. I leave the weekends for that. On Fridays, I like to hang out with friends. We normally meet at a bar, chat, and have something to eat and drink. But I'm not really a night owl, so I like to be back home by 930 tops. So many activities. I don't think I could keep up that pace, but it's nice to know you enjoy it to the fullest, Maria. I think I'll try to go out more often in the evening as well. Sure, Brian. Just don't forget to give yourself time to rest. Find what your interests are and have some fun.",
